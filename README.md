# RAG-Document-QnA-Groq-Llama3-OpenAIEmbeddings

Here in this, there are two pdf's in researc_paper folder. Now, you can interact with those papers using RAG-Document

I have used Groq Llama3 to interact with the document and OpenAIEmbeddings to conver the pdf content into the vectorestore form.

You will need to add the OPENAI API Key and Groq API Key in your .env file.
